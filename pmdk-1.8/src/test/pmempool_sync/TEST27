# pmempool_sync/TEST27 -- test for sync command with badblocks
#                         - bad blocks in a regular file
#                         - blocks: offset: 0 length: 16
#
# This test verifies whether pmempool-sync is able to fix bad blocks
# in the first 8kB of the pool (in the pool header) located in a regular file.
