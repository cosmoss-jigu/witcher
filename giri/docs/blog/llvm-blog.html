  <h2>[GSoC 2013] Giri: Dynamic Program Slicing in LLVM</h2>

  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_slicing">Program slicing</a> computes all statements in a program that directly or indirectly affect the value of a variable or instruction.
  Static program slicing computes all statements that <i>may</i> affect the value of a variable at a program point for <i>any</i> arbitrary execution of the program.
  Instead, dynamic program slicing computes all statements that actually affect the value of a variable/instruction at a program point for a <i>particular</i> execution of the program with <i>given</i> input.
  There are many applications which use (or could benefit from) dynamic slicing.
  For example, it has long been used in software debugging and testing.
  However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available dynamic slicing tool in either LLVM, GCC or Open64.</p>

  <p>Giri is a dynmic slicing tool implemented in LLVM compiler infrastructure by <a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~ssahoo2/" target="_blank">Swarup Kumar Sahoo</a>, <a href="http://www.bigw.org/~jcriswel" target="_blank">John Criswell</a>, and <a href="http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/~vadve/" target="_blank">Vikram Adve</a>.
  They used backward dynamic slicing to filter/remove false positives from the candidate root causes for automated software fault localization (<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2451131">ASPLOS'13</a>).
  The tool collects the trace of a particular program execution and finally reports the dynamic slice of a given statement using the trace.
  It also maps LLVM intermediate representation (IR) statements to source code using the debug meta-data to report the dynamic slice in terms of source line numbers.
  To make the Giri up-to-date and robust for general use, <a href="http://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liuml07" target="_blank">Mingliang Liu</a> and  <a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~ssahoo2/" target="_blank">Swarup Kumar Sahoo</a> further enhanced it in several ways.
  For example, they reduced the trace size, made the Giri thread-aware and improved the performance of run-time.
  
  <h3>Dynamic Program Slicing</h3>
  <p>The following is an example C program, which is based on the program 1 of the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=93576" target="_blank">paper</a> where dynamic program slicing was first proposed.
  Given the input <tt>10</tt> to this program, the source line numbers that affect the return value are: <tt>13, 20, 27, 40, 42, 44, 47</tt>.
  The line numbers <tt>13, 20</tt> are included due to control dependence, while line numbers <tt>27, 40, 42, 44, 47</tt> are included due to data dependence.
  Note that the line numbers <tt>15, 22</tt> should be included in static slices,
  but neither of them is included in dynamic slices since neither of them actually has influence on the return value for the input <tt>10</tt>.</p>

  <p>The default starting point of slicing (criterion) is the <tt>return</tt> instruction of the <tt>main</tt> function.
  Note that there is only one <tt>return</tt> when the main executes.
  Giri also supports two more ways to specify the starting criterion of the slice.
  The first is to define the slicing criterion by line number of a source file.
  The second is to start slice from a given LLVM instruction number.
  In the second case, one should provide the function name and the instruction number
  (Every LLVM instruction is assigned a unique number by the <tt>SourceLineMapping</tt> pass).
  See the <a href="https://github.com/liuml07/giri/wiki/Example-Usage" target="_blank">example usage</a> for more information.</p>

  <h3>The Design of Giri</h3>
  <img src="giri-flow.jpg" alt="Giri Architecture" width="80%"/>
  <p>As shown in the above figure, Giri has two phases.
  In the first pass named <i>tracing</i> pass, it instruments the code to record various runtime information in a trace file for all threads for a particular execution.
  In the second pass named <i>slicing</i> pass, it uses the execution trace to create a program dependence graph for computing dynamic slice.</p>

  <p>The tracing pass instruments code to record three different pieces of information:
  1) basic block exits, 2) memory accesses and their addresses, and 3) function calls and returns.
  First, the basic block (BB) exit is recorded in the trace to provide branch taken information (execution path) for the second pass.
  Second, Giri instruments the program to record the memory locations accessed by all <tt>loads</tt>, <tt>stores</tt>, and <tt>select</tt> C library functions.
  This information is used in the second phase to find all the <tt>store</tt> instructions that created the value read by a <tt>load</tt> instruction.
  Since most instructions operate on SSA scalar values, we only refer to trace file whenever needed.
  For example, we can get all the operands of an <tt>add</tt> instruction from the program SSA form without accessing the trace file.
  However, when we try to find all the <tt>store</tt> instructions which feed value to a <tt>load</tt> instruction, we need to scan the trace file since the data read by the <tt>load</tt> instruction may be written by many possible <tt>store</tt> instructions, which can only be determined accurately at runtime.
  Third, Giri instruments a program to record the execution of function calls and function returns, which is useful to match up formal and and actual arguments and callers/callee return values during the second phase for both direct and indirect function calls.
  Finally, to make the slicing pass thread aware, the runtime library writes the thread id (<tt>pthread_t</tt>) to each record indicating current thread performing that operation.
  We use locks when we write trace records to the trace file in order to avoid race conditions.</p>
  
  <p>The slicing pass initializes a work list with the starting instruction of slicing.
  For each dynamic value in the work list, the slicing pass computes both data-flow and control-flow dependences for it using program SSA form and trace.
  First, we compute all the dynamic instructions which influence the current dynamic value under consideration through direct flow of data values.
  Next, static control-dependence analysis is employed to determine which values or instructions can directly force the execution of the basic block to which this dynamic value belongs.
  Then, the slicing pass uses the trace records to find the most recent dynamic instance of those values or instructions which forces the execution of this dynamic value.
  The dynamic values computed by control or data dependence are added to the work list if not already processed earlier.
  The slicing pass does not stop until all dynamic values in the work list are processed.
  The slicing pass checks the thread id when scanning the trace file for a given dynamic value or basic block.
  In the end, it reports the dynamic slice of the program execution from the slice starting point in terms of LLVM instructions as well as the source code line numbers.</p>

  <h3>Project Status</h3>
  <p>Giri code is up-to-date with the latest LLVM version and was published at <a href="https://github.com/liuml07/giri" target=_blank>https://github.com/liuml07/giri</a>.
  We tested the code with many unit tests.
  There is a simple test framework which runs all the test cases and report the results.
  We shall make sure all unit tests pass locally before submitting a new patch to the code repository.
  Giri was able to handle few large real programs like Squid, Apache, MySQL.
  To slice multi-threading programs, we made the Giri run-time library thread safe and the slicing pass thread aware.</p>

  <p>Giri is still under development and pull requests are heavily welcome.
  The following is the list of future work we are going to address in the next months.</p>
  <ul>
	<li> Improve the performance of locking mechanism of the Giri runtime.
	<li> Try more real world programs and add them to the <tt>test/</tt> directory.</li>
	<li> Support slicing multiple bitcode files individually for one program.</li>
	<li> Make Giri code useful for other platforms besides Linux, e.g. Mac OS X, Cygwin, and FreeBSD.</li>
	<li> Parallelize the code which writes the entry cache containing trace records to trace file and adds trace records to the entry cache.</li>
  </ul>
