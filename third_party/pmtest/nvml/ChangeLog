	* Version 1.0
	The API of six libraries (libpmem, libpmemblk, libpmemlog,
	libpmemobj, libvmem, libvmmalloc) is complete and stable.
	The on-media layout of persistent memory pools will be maintained
	from this point, and if changed it will be backward compatible.
	Man pages are all complete.
	This release has been validated to "Production quality".

	For the purpose of new features planned for next releases of NVML
	there have been some API modifications made:
		- pmem: pmem_map replaced with pmem_map_file
		- log/blk: 'off_t' substituted with 'long long'
		- obj: type numbers extended to 64-bit
		- obj: new entry points and macros added:
		  pmemobj_tx_errno, pmemobj_tx_lock, pmemobj_mutex_timedlock,
		  TX_ADD_DIRECT, TX_ADD_FIELD_DIRECT, TX_SET_DIRECT

	Other key changes since version 0.4 include:
		- common: updated/fixed installation scripts
		- common: eliminated dependency on libuuid
		- pmem: CPU features/ISA detection using CPUID
		- obj: improved error handling
		- obj: atomic allocation fails if constructor returns error
		- obj: multiple performance optimizations
		- obj: object store refactoring
		- obj: additional examples and benchmarks

	This release also introduces a prototype implementation
	of C++ bindings for libpmemobj.  Note that C++ API is still
	experimental and should not be used in production environments.

	* Version 0.4
	This NVML version primarily focuses on improving code quality
	and reliability.  In addition to a couple of bug fixes,
	the changes include:
		- benchmarks for libpmemobj, libpmemblk and libvmem
		- additional pmemobj tests and examples
		- pool mapping address randomization
		- added pmempool "rm" command
		- eliminated libpmem dependency on libpthread
		- enabled extra warnings
		- minor performance improvements
	Man pages are all complete.
	This release is considered "Beta quality" by the team, having
	been thoroughly validated, including significant performance analysis.
	The pmempool command does not yet support "check" and "repair"
	operations for pmemobj type pools.

	* Version 0.3
	NVML is now feature complete, adding support for:
		- pool sets
		- pmemobj local replication (active/passive)
		- experimental valgrind support
		- pmempool support for all pool types
	Man pages are all complete.
	This release is considered "Alpha quality" by the team, having
	gone through significant validation but only some performance
	analysis at this point.

	* Version 0.2
	NVML now consists of six libraries:
		- libpmem                            (basic flushing, etc)
		- libpmemblk, libpmemlog, libpmemobj (transactions)
		- libvmem, libvmmalloc               (volatile use of pmem)
	The "pmempool" command is available for managing pmem files.
	Man pages for all the above are complete.
	The only things documented in man pages but not implemented are:
		- pmem sets (ability to spread a pool over a set of files)
		- replication (coming for libpmemobj)
	The pmempool command does not yet support pmemobj type pools.

	Initial development done in 0.1 builds
