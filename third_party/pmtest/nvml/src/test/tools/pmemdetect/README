Linux NVM Library

This is src/test/tools/pmemdetect/README.

This directory contains a simple application for PMEM-aware filesystem
detection.  If the 'path' argument points to a directory on a PMEM device,
the program exits with a status code indicating success.  Otherwise,
the status code indicates failure.

It's used as a helper program by some unit tests.

Usage:
	$ pmemdetect <path>
