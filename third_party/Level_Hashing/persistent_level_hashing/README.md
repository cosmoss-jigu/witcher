# Persistent Level Hashing 

The code for persistent level hashing, run in the simulated NVM platform, i.e., [Quartz](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/quartz).

## How to run

1.  Build the Quartz emulator;
2.  Change the `path-to-pmalloc.h-in-Quartz` in `log.h` to yours;
3.  Copy the `libnvmemul.so` file generated by your Quartz into this folder;
4.  Do `make` to generate an executable file `plevel`;
5.  Run `plevel` in Quartz: `scripts/runenv.sh <your_app>`;
